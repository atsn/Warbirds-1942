# Warbirds/1942 remake

**I want to make it clear that I have not made this game from the bottom**
I started with a version where the only thing happening was the plane flying and some island the rest I have added. 
You can see the original game as my first commit.
This is a project that I have made for A Game Developments Class During my education. 
I have changes some things and added some things as well but I am not the maker of this game.
because this game is made for school I have made some choices that wouldnâ€™t make sense if you only looked at is as a game.

Here is a list of features

 I have made the following controls
  -	w for Up
  -	s for Down
  -	a for Left 
  -	d for Right
  -  b for Upgrade Bulley
  -	l for Extra Life
  -  p for shield
  -	k to go to the end of the current level
  -	n to go to the next level
  
  the game has 7 levels the first five is just to show off the features and the last 2 is to show of how the game would play
	
 Each plane has its own Ai 
  -	green fly slowly backward and shoots the best bullet after you, 50 lives
  -	White follows you until it hits you, 10 lives
  -	Yellow stays where it is and shoot directly at you, 11 lives
  -	Blue flies across the screen and when it leaves the screen it changes behaviour and chase the player, 21 lives

  You can change the following settings in the main menu
  -	Difficulty
  -  -   Changes your health
  -  -   Changes the amount of point you get per kill
  -  -   Changes the health of the shield
  -	Sound
  -	Music
  
  While playing the game you can get the following powerups from enemies
  -  Upgrade bullet, this gives you a better bullet, the bullet has tree levels
  -  -  normal bullet 10 damage
  -  -  Duble bullet 20 damage
  -  -  Power bullet 50 damage
  -  Shield
  -  Extra lives
  You also risk that a dead enemy drops a bomb which does 50 damage of you hit it
